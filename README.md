# Low-Level Playground

Remembering how computers work: ASM, C, syscalls. 

The following examples should be implemented here:
- Simple ASM application with the FASM compiler
- Simple C application that loads and executes ASM code (using the _mmap_ function)
- Simple hand-written LLVM IR application (compiled with CLang)
- Brainfuck interpreter and JIT compiler (written in C)
- Simple ARC4 implementation with C (GCC vs CLang) and CPU profilers
- C application compiled to WASM (wasm vs wat) and executed in a browser
- Makefiles as a building infrastructure
- C3 language examples (using SIMD)
- Zig language examples
